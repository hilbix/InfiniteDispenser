However this Repo apparently was pulled before the malicious code was added.
I inspected the code carefully and the most disturbing part in it is the stats callback.
So from my perspective the code is safe, I would run it on my own server if I need it.

For more information read the Wiki at https://github.com/hilbix/InfiniteDispenser/wiki

About
=====

InfiniteDispenser is a Bukkit plugin to allow Dispensers to work indifinitely.  It is controlled by signs.

There apparently is a replacement at http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/infinitydispenser/ which is maintained and ready to install.
However it has a bigger code base (as it hase much more features).
