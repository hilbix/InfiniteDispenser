InfiniteDispenser
=================

[Info]

This is a plugin that allows you to create an "Infinite Dispenser" on a
CraftBukkit Minecraft server. What this does is allows any dispenser with
a special sign on it to be constantly refilled automatically any time it
gets empty.


[Want to know how it works?]

Do you even Open Source?

Do whatever you want with it, just credit me for whatever parts
of my code you use.
